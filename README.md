# terraform-azurerm-aks

This is my first module so bear with me, so far it deploys, resource group, vnet & subnet, example of use can be found
https://github.com/subzone/aks_module_example_use 

Plan is to complete it until version 1.0.0, so everything working with 0.x.x versions is still experimental.
